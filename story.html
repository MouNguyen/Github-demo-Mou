            What is the one philosophy that drives
            <font style="color: #910197">SCAAL? </font>We believe that no matter
            where you go, you should always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure
            of a goad cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At home,
            reading the morning paper. At your local products SCAAL, conversing
            with a confidant. Or perhaps in some foreign land, SCAAL will be
            greeting you like an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that
            transcends alll cultural boundaries. It makes us feel alert,
            energetic and alive.

            Where we began
          </p>

          <p>
            Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in
            Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he listened to stories of his
            grandfather Oluf’s adventures and expeditions, Often his grandfather
            would bring back exotic coffees for the family to enjoy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the Parisian cafes and
            Italian espresso bars, He worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and
            New Guinea, And in a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting
            the perfect coffee bean and roasting it to perfection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique blends of coffee and a
            stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to gather -
            day or night — not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670 cities around
            the world.
          </p>

          <p style="color: #848420; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2rem">
            Where makes SCAAL the best coffee?
          </p>

          <p>
            Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned a8 an apprentice in
            the coffee fields to every buyer, roaster, and franchise owner.
            SCAAL's standards for coffee are never compromised, We only select
            SHB — strictly hard bean or strictly high grown — coffee beans. To
            ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, extraordinary steps are
            taken to protect the coffee bean from heat, light, air and moisture.
          </p>

          <p>
            All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect cup of
            coffee.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to
            extraordinary efforts to ensure that SCAAL is your best choice, The
            quality begins at harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a
            labor- intensive process that involves making several passes among
            the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we select
            top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high
            grown Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above
            sea level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to
            you, the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified
            Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich
            aroma.
